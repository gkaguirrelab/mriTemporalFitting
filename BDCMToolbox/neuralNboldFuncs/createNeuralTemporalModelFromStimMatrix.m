%% createNeuralTemporalModelFromStimMatrix
%
% This function creates a model of neural response given a vector of
% stimulus input, a vector of time points, and a set of parameters.
%
% The model includes the following stages:
%
%  - a neural impulse response function (modeled as a gamma function)
%  - a compressive non-linearity
%  - a delayed, divisive normalization stage
%    [or, a simple multiplicative exponential decay temporal scaling]
%  - an after-response
%
% The approach is inspired by:
%
%   Zhou, Benson, Kay, Winawer (2016) VSS annual meeting
%   Temporal Summation and Adaptation in Human Visual Cortex
%
%   With additional modeling details taken from:
%
%   McLelland, D., Ahmed, B., & Bair, W. (2009). Responses to static visual
%   images in macaque lateral geniculate nucleus: implications for
%   adaptation, negative afterimages, and visual fading.
%   The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(28), 8996-9001.
%
%   McLelland, D., Baker, P. M., Ahmed, B., & Bair, W. (2010).
%   Neuronal responses during and after the presentation of static visual
%   stimuli in macaque primary visual cortex.
%   The Journal of Neuroscience, 30(38), 12619-12631.
%
% This model implements a negative after-response. Based upon the findings
%   of McLelland et al., 2010, it seems that (for the most part) V1 neurons
%   respond with an after-response that has an amplitude that is
%   proportional to the main response, with a very similar time constant.
%
%   We adopt these properties in the model by treating the after-response
%   as an inverted, shifted, and scaled version of the main-response.
%
% Input properties:
%
%   t - a vector of time points, in seconds
%   yStimulus - a vector of stimulus amplitude. The length must be the same
%               as t. The absolute amplitude is arbitraty.
%   displayFitPlotIn - Boolean flag indicating if you want a plot. Optional.
%   paramIn - a structure of parameters that define the model. These are
%             described below. Optional.
%
% Output properties:
%
%   yBOLD - a vector of response amplitudes, of the same length as t.
%   t - the temporal vector
%   paramOut - the parameters passed back out
