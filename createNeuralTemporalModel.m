%% createNeuralTemporalModel
%
% This function creates a model of neural response given a vector of
% stimulus input, a vector of time points, and a set of parameters.
%
% The model includes the following stages:
%
%  - a neural impulse response function (modeled as a gamma function)
%  - a compressive non-linearity
%  - a delayed, divisive normalization stage
%    [or, a simple multiplicative exponential decay temporal scaling]
%  - an after-response
%
% The approach is inspired by:
%
%   Zhou, Benson, Kay, Winawer (2016) VSS annual meeting
%   Temporal Summation and Adaptation in Human Visual Cortex
%
%   With additional modeling details taken from:
%
%   McLelland, D., Ahmed, B., & Bair, W. (2009). Responses to static visual
%   images in macaque lateral geniculate nucleus: implications for
%   adaptation, negative afterimages, and visual fading. 
%   The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(28), 8996-9001.
%
%   McLelland, D., Baker, P. M., Ahmed, B., & Bair, W. (2010). 
%   Neuronal responses during and after the presentation of static visual
%   stimuli in macaque primary visual cortex.
%   The Journal of Neuroscience, 30(38), 12619-12631.
%
% This model implements a negative after-response. Based upon the findings
%   of McLelland et al., 2010, it seems that (for the most part) V1 neurons
%   respond with an after-response that has an amplitude that is
%   proportional to the main response, with a very similar time constant.
%
%   We adopt these properties in the model by treating the after-response
%   as an inverted, shifted, and scaled version of the main-response.
%
% Input properties:
%
%   t - a vector of time points, in seconds
%   yStimulus - a vector of stimulus amplitude. The length must be the same
%               as t. The absolute amplitude is arbitraty.
%   displayFitPlotIn - Boolean flag indicating if you want a plot. Optional.
%   paramIn - a structure of parameters that define the model. These are
%             described below. Optional.
%
% Output properties:
%
%   yBOLD - a vector of response amplitudes, of the same length as t.
%   t - the temporal vector
%   paramOut - the parameters passed back out

%% Implement the neural stage
% Define the neuralIRF, which is a gamma function that transforms the
% stimulus input into a profile of neural activity (e.g., LFP)
neuralIRF = t .* exp(-t/param.tau1);

% scale to unit sum to preserve amplitude of y following convolution
neuralIRF=neuralIRF/sum(neuralIRF);

% Obtain first stage, linear model, which is the stimulus vector with a 
% multiplicative amplitude parameter, then convolved by the neural IRF.

% Truncate the convolved vector to the input length. Not sure why I have to
% do this. Probably mis-using the conv function.
yLinear = yLinear(1:modelLength);

%% Implement the compressive non-linearity stage
% Obtain second stage, CTS model, which is the output of the linear stage
% subjected to a compressive non-linearity. While this is implemented here
% as a power law function, it is worth noting that very similar functions
% are produced by implementing this as an instantaneous divisive
% normalization.
yCTS = yLinear.^param.epsilon;

%% As we are modeling MRI data, we are currently skipping several features
% of the Zhou & Winawer model. We use the decaying exponential only as a
% multiplicative weight for the neural response.
%
% %% Implement the delayed, divisive normalization stage.
% % (Instantaneous) divisive normalization is described by:
% %
% %  yResponse = Input^n / (sigma^n + Input^n)
% %
% % The computation is implemented over time by weighting the input by a
% % temporal decay function:
% %
% %  yResponseDN(t) = Input(t)^n / (sigma^n + (Input(t) * decay(t))^n)
% %
% % where '*' indicates here convolution and decay is a decaying exponential
% % that is defined by the parameter tau2
% %
% % Create the exponential low-pass function that defines the time-domain
% % properties of the normalization
%  decayingExponential=(exp(-1*param.tau2*t));
% 
% % scale to have unit sum to preserve amplitude after convolution
% decayingExponential=decayingExponential/sum(decayingExponential);

% % do this. Probably mis-using the conv function.

%% Implement a decaying exponential scaling of the response
%
% This is implemented instead of the divisive normalization approach
% followed in the original Zhou & Winawer model.
%
% The tau2 parameter describes the time constant of this multiplicative
% scaling.
%

% Create the exponential low-pass function that defines the time-domain
% properties of the normalization
decayingExponential=(exp(-1*param.tau2*t));

% Shift and scale the exponential so that the peak coincides with the
% initial peak response in the yCTS model. This is needed to unconfound the
% overall amplitude response parameter from the exponential decay
% parameter.

% Apply the exponential function as a mulitiplicative scaling of the
% response.

yNeuralMR = yCTS.*decayingExponential;

% This is assumed to be a shifted, scaled version of the main response.

% Scale, invert, shift, and blank out the circular wrapping)

yNeural = nansum([yNeuralMR;yNeuralAR]);

%% Rectify yNeural

% yNeural has a negative after-response, reflecting what is observed in LFP
% measurements. The param.rectify setting controls if this is converted to
% a rectified measure to reflect total total synaptic activity, which may
% be the better model for input to the BOLD system.
